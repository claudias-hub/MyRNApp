# MyRNApp

## Overview

MyRNApp is a simple chat application built with React Native and Expo. It features a welcoming start screen where users can enter their name and select a background color for the chat interface. The app then navigates to a chat screen where users can send and receive messages in real-time (locally simulated).

This project was developed as part of a learning exercise to practice React Native development, navigation, and UI styling.
